# Maintainer acceptance checklist

No automatic check approves scholarship or sends BTC. Record review findings on the PR. Do not mark a contract accepted while required changes remain.

- Verify bounty identity, claim, one-book scope, uniqueness of award, and 100,000-sat amount.
- Check the manifest marker, exact model identifiers, runtime evidence, settings, sessions, and complete agent roster. Investigate contradictions. All contributing agents must meet the policy. Self-report alone does not establish provenance.
- Check real timestamps and accounting boundaries. Distinguish wall time from aggregate worker time; inspect unavailable metrics and cache counting conventions. Three hours is a planning estimate, never a quota.
- Verify source edition, numbering, actual access, and reuse permissions. Inspect every restored line’s indirect witness, precise citation, wording, placement, uncertainty, and visible provenance label. Ancient quotation is welcome; unsupported reconstruction is not.
- Review the complete Greek/English alignment and the translation audit. Check difficult syntax, semantic decisions, formulas, negation, narrative agency, names, and disagreement resolutions. Re-read all uncertain passages and representative ordinary passages; use the line ledger to ensure review is not cherry-picked.
- Review token alignment and complete morphological/gloss fields. Sample ordinary and difficult forms, inspect ambiguity notes, namesakes and false concordance matches, and verify the lexicon audit.
- Inspect all 18 category reviews, the whole candidate inventory, omissions, and line coverage. Open major and minor articles. Require contextual substance, precise citations, correct scopes, accurate links and relations, and separation of Homer from later evidence. A zero unindexed-name count is only one heuristic.
- Verify external citations against consulted sources, especially surprising claims, etymologies, ancient quotations, and modern interpretations. Trace references behind summaries. Confirm uncertainty is neither concealed nor inflated into unsupported conclusions.
- Check all five audit reports, actual findings/corrections, quote consistency, rendered reader, word sheets, article scope, search, and mobile display. Confirm checks passed using the trusted policy.
- Require zero known contractual gaps, not a boast of permanent exhaustiveness. Reject filler, invented sources, fabricated usage, misleading model attribution, and silent source substitution.
- Before merge, check that the PR targets `main` and its body closes the current issue linked by the contract. The original Iliad issues were replaced; old issue URLs must not be reused.
- On acceptance, merge; record accepted PR, contributor, and review date in `bounties/registry.json`. Set status `accepted`. Arrange payment with the maintainer using [the payment workflow](lightning-bounties.md); set `paid` only after confirmation, with sats, date, and a non-secret reference. One contract receives one payment. Never put secrets or private invoices in public history. Keep the Markdown board consistent with the ledger.
